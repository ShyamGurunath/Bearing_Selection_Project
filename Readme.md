### Bearing Selection System

#### Abstract

In a deep groove ball bearing first of all to select a bearing and to find out the radial load, axial load, equivalent load and then find out the life ratting factor of bearing. Designer can design a good life of bearing by using this calculation.

Designer are design a 100% of bearing but only 90% of bearing will be successful and 10% of bearing will be failure. The manufacture recommendation is to design a 100% of bearing to 99% of bearing will be successful to ask to designer. This one not easy for designer it’s very difficult to given output 99% of bearing become succeed and then given to user. The lots of steps involved to calculate and give good reliability given to the user this takes more time. That’s why we are plan to create a software by using python programmed in a method of web application to easy to expand bearing life time.

In this project the user can directly use this software. User will install this software and then easily to find out the capacity of bearing by user. That’s the advantage of this software.

After software will install by user then user can put all input data of bearing. And then automatically calculated and find out the capacity of bearing for user recommendation.


#### METHODLOGY 

In a deep groove ball bearing three steps are used in this methodology they are

Step 1: Selection of bearing.
Step 2: Calculate the radial load, axial load, and equivalent load.
Step 3: Calculate the bearing Life rating.


#### Step by step procedure

    - User can give the input of impeller in radial and axial load.
    - User can select a bearing of 6th series in first designation.
    - User can mention the estimation year and hours bearing will be run.
    - After given the all data of bearing and then radial load and axial load are calculated.
    - Front bearing is locked after find out the radial and axial load.
    - Then radial load will be changed after front bearing are locked but axial load remains same.
    - To find out the equivalent load of the bearing and then find out the life rating factor of bearing.
    - The life rating is more than the user recommendation bearing will safe other than that that user can change the designation and series of bearing that’s also failed another designation and series are used.
    - If Bearing will be failure after four designation are used. User can change the impeller design or change the diameter of bearing

#### Conclusion

This project is made with pre planning, that provides flexibility in operation, derivable and economical. This project deep groove ball bearing is designed with the hope of python program it is very help full to increase the bearing life for industries. This project helped us to know the periodic steps in completing a project work. Thus, we have completed the project successfully.
